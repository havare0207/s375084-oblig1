Hello Health App

Description:

- This project is a simple health tracker demo that collects a patient’s name and temperature while generating a unique ID for identification. 

- It uses input validation and logging to simulate how healthcare systems monitor patient data. 

- The project exists to demonstrate basic Python concepts such as user input, error handling, loops, hashing, and logging.


Installation Instructions:

1. Cloning the repository:

- git clone repository-url

- cd repository-folder

2. Creating a virtual environment:

- Use the command python3 -m venv .venv to create a virtual environment.
   - Python 3 is used to ensure compatibility with systems that also have Python 2 installed.


- It will create the virtual environment, and a folder named .venv/


3. Activating the virtual environment:

- Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\Activate

- Mac/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate


4. Running the application:

- To run the application, either:
    - write python hello_health.py in the terminal
    - or use the Run Python File button in the top right corner in the hello_health.py file


- Experiencing slow startup?:

   - The program may start slightly slower the first time it is executed.

   - This happens because the terminal and Python environment need to initialize.

   - Subsequent runs will usually be faster.

   - The first run may take approximately 5 seconds depending on the system.


Requirements:

- Python 3.13.11 or higher

- No external dependencies (Obligation 1)
